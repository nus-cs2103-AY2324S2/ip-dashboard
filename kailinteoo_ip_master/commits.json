Ui Class:\n   - Extracted UI-related methods from the main class into a separate Ui class.\n   - The Ui class handles interactions with the user, including displaying information about marking/unmarking tasks, listing details, and removing tasks.\n\n2. Storage Class:\n   - Created a Storage class to handle loading tasks from and saving tasks to a file.\n   - The class includes methods for saving tasks to a file (saveTasks), loading tasks from a file (loadTasks), and ensuring the existence of the data folder and file (ensureFolderAndFileExists).\n\n3. Parser Class:\n   - Introduced a Parser class responsible for parsing user commands.\n   - The parseCommand method splits the user command and returns relevant parts, aiding in processing user inputs.\n\n4. TaskList Class:\n   - Refactored the main class to create a TaskList class, which manages the task list.\n   - The TaskList class contains methods for marking/unmarking tasks, listing tasks, removing tasks, and adding new tasks based on user commands.\n\nThese changes improve code organization, readability, and maintainability by adhering to object-oriented principles and separating concerns into distinct classes.
