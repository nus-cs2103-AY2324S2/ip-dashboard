Future iterations can look into creating a separate chatbot\nclass and instance separate from the main() function.\n","tags":["Level-2"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":39,"deletions":16}}},{"hash":"bb5e361c7eb87aca32ef2295e93c435e608c1f58","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add Task class","messageBody":"","tags":["A-Classes"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":46,"deletions":0}}},{"hash":"f370b288848d2d1dfe42f95ce71b45587d8002f1","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Add TaskList class","messageBody":"","tags":["A-Collections"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":63,"deletions":0}}},{"hash":"e0f51c261c32ae1607c8a9b532b6cddc8986d150","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Refactor Duke and TaskList","messageBody":"Duke:\n- Remove all previous functions and replace with an echo() function.\n- Standard messages are now stored as constants.\n\nTaskList:\n- markTask() and unmarkTask() now return String as output feedback.\n\nDuke is refactored as many functions serve to only print a message.\nIt is redundant to create many functions to print to output.\necho() serves as a way to print output through the chatbot.\n\nTaskList functions should return a message that will be sent as\nfeedback for the users.
